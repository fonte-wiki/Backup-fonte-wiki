#### The 7 cooperative principles

Found for instance [here](https://ncbaclusa.coop/resources/7-cooperative-principles/) and [here](https://www.electric.coop/seven-cooperative-principles%E2%80%8B):

1. Open and Voluntary Membership
Membership in a cooperative is open to all people who can reasonably use its services and stand willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, regardless of race, religion, gender, or economic circumstances.

2. Democratic Member Control
Cooperatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting policies and making decisions. Representatives (directors/trustees) are elected among the membership and are accountable to them. In primary cooperatives, members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote); cooperatives at other levels are organized in a democratic manner.

3. Members’ Economic Participation
Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their cooperative. At least part of that capital remains the common property of the cooperative. Members allocate surpluses for any or all of the following purposes: developing the cooperative; setting up reserves; benefiting members in proportion to their transactions with the cooperative; and supporting other activities approved by the membership.

4. Autonomy and Independence
Cooperatives are autonomous, self-help organizations controlled by their members. If they enter into agreements with other organizations, including governments, or raise capital from external sources, they do so on terms that ensure democratic control as well as their unique identity.

5. Education, Training, and Information
Education and training for members, elected representatives (directors/trustees), CEOs, and employees help them effectively contribute to the development of their cooperatives. Communications about the nature and benefits of cooperatives, particularly with the general public and opinion leaders, help boost cooperative understanding.

6. Cooperation Among Cooperatives
By working together through local, national, regional and international structures, cooperatives improve services, bolster local economies, and deal more effectively with social and community needs.

7. Concern for Community
Cooperatives work for the sustainable development of their communities through policies supported by the membership.


### Mediação e comunidades

> Também incluídas na [lista semente](/listas/semente).

## Mediação e Comunidades

- [CommunityRule](https://communityrule.info/) has straightforward templates for community governance.
- [Mediación Cultural en Medialab Prado](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sprdd6NZqPU) (Spanish).
- [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/).
- [Here comes everybody](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/300615/here-comes-everybody-by-clay-shirky/), by Clay Shirky. [Goodreads page](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1998185.Here_Comes_Everybody) and [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8wR-GXeOQo).
- A classic: Howard Rheingold's ["The Art of Hosting Good Conversations Online"](http://www.rheingold.com/texts/artonlinehost.html). Rheingold was also the author of "[Virtual Community](http://www.rheingold.com/vc/book/)". 
- [Radical Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70CNGXQ1-eY), about Burning Man.
- [The Art of Community](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EI6YcKlTdzojLD4RdVjYVlmFRTNzzge0/view) (full book in PDF)
- Some interesting references on online communities:
	- [How to kickstart a community](https://meta.discourse.org/t/how-to-kick-start-a-community/51295/2) (in the context of [discourse](https://discourse.org/), a software for online forums, but has useful tips overall). More about using discourse for online communities [here](https://blog.discourse.org/2014/08/building-a-discourse-community/) and [here](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/08/launching-a-successful-discourse-community/).
	- Feverbee talks about principles of online communities. I don't agree with much of their vocabulary and assumptions (for instance "[building addictive communities](https://vimeo.com/109945437)"), but like their idea of [Superusers](https://www.feverbee.com/superusercasestudy/).  And there may be relevant cases and advice [here](https://www.feverbee.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/theprovenpath.pdf).

Another relatively old piece on ("web") communities that may still be valuable: [The 12 principles of collaboration](http://endofweb.pbworks.com/f/12principles.pdf). They are:

1. Purpose: We have a shared goal or interest.
2. Identity: We know who’s who.
3. Reputation: We recognize and build status based on our actions.
4. Governance: We agree that our behavior can be regulated according to shared or stated values.
5. Communication: We have ways to share information and ideas
6. Groups: We can relate to each other in smaller numbers.
7. Environment: We interact in a shared space that is appropriate to our goals.
8. Boundaries: We know who belongs and who doesn’t.
9. Trust: We know with whom we’re dealing and that it’s safe to do so.
10. Exchange: We can trade knowledge, support, goods, services, and ideas.
11. Expression: We have a group identity and know what other members are doing. We can easily indicate our preferences and opinions.
12. History: We can look back over our history and track our evolution.
