# Semente

Semente is a toolkit in the making to co-create community-based digital policy. Its current prototype results from a collaboration between the Instituto Neos in Brazil and the University of Bristol. Semente builds knowledge exchange in projects such as [fonte.wiki](https://fonte.wiki) and [ID21](/id21). It is informed by decades of digital rights activism in Brazil and the intention to regenerate fair and inclusive futures with the critical appropriation of digital technologies.

The attached [slide presentation (PDF)](https://archive.org/details/semente-23) presents a short overview of the process of building the first prototype of Semente.
