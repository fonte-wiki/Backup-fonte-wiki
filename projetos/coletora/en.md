# Coletora (English)

*[Coletora](/projetos/coletora)* is an open (open-source, open-ended) and emerging methodology informed by 20+ years of community-centred activity. The notes in this wiki are an exercise of simultaneous reflection and practice.

It all starts (does anything ever really?) with [a spring](en/spring). And then, some thoughts on [collecting](/projetos/coletora/en/collecting). At some point, [mapping](en/mapping) may be useful too.

> **Reminder:** the English and [Portuguese](/projetos/coletora/pt) of this research documentation wiki will evolve separately. Some pages will be translated, others not. That's intentional.

\* **Coletora** is a feminine singular noun in Portuguese. It is used in diverse contexts - from a [type of road](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_coletora) to the [collection of rain- and waste-water](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81gua_pluvial#Rede_coletora_de_esgoto_x_rede_coletora_de_%C3%A1guas_pluviais). Its masculine form *coletor* (in the highly gendered language that is Portuguese) is also used to signify "gatherer" in *[ca√ßador-coletor](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ca%C3%A7ador-coletor)*, or "[hunter-gatherer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer)".
