# La Loire

One river, many stories.


## Benjaminian

On my first day in Nevers for [NØSCHOOL 2025](https://noschoolnevers.com/), [Benjamin Gaulon](https://recyclism.com/index.html) offered some of the guests a ride to our accommodation. I accepted, and at some point along the way waiting for a traffic light, noticed a small sign: "Esplanade Walter Benjamin". I took a mental note of visiting it later, curiously noticing that I was being driven by another Benjamin.

> (I'll write later about my visit to the Esplanade on that afternoon. If you're reading this message, don't worry. It's not an unedited leftover. I'm exploring live-writing this wiki section and website, and leaving comments along the way. This website will never be finished).

That afternoon (or the next), a German student asked me what I thought of Benjamin. Walter Benjamin, that is. My first answers were obvious mentions to [Angelus Novus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelus_Novus) in his [Theses on the Philosophy of History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theses_on_the_Philosophy_of_History) and [The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction). I probably mentioned Leo Foletto's [Cópia na era de sua proliferação técnica](https://baixacultura.org/2024/10/25/copia-desvio-parte-i/). But as the conversation went on, I thought again of one particular image: the ragpicker. Le chiffonier. Or in the original German term: the Lumpensammler.

> Another note - I'll get back to this later. Too many references for now, and I need some sleep.
> P.S.: editing wiki pages at late night, not knowing whether someone was reading it in between edits, takes me 20 years back and happy.
