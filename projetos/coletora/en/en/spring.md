# The Spring

**[Coletora - English](/projetos/coletora/en)**

One beautiful aspect of doing independent and exploratory research across languages is how much it expands my horizons. For instance, the term *spring*. I type this paragraph on the morning of 24/09/2025. Here in Berlin, the summer has clearly gone away three days ago, with unexpected [Equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox) precision ("German precision" being much more a world renowned cultural expectation than objective fact makes it even more ironic). The sun has just crossed the Equator line towards the south hemisphere, and will only tilt back in this direction in another six months. On the other hand, there in that part of the world where my heart is rooted, the **spring** has just started.

So yes, a first meaning for this term. The spring. Frühling. Tim Maia singing "[É Primavera](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primavera_(Vai_Chuva))". I'll make it the first song of my Coletora playlist. Spring, the season. But also spring, olho d'água, a source of water streaming from inside the earth. I suspect these meanings are connected, here in the northern of the northern hemisphere (but I won't google it, so will take the risk of having gotten it wrong, or else sounding too obvious for native English speakers). Is the spring (the season) that time of the year when water springs return to be seen flowing from the earth, after the white snow is gone? Do springs return to life in during the spring, so to say?

The initial link in another page, from where I created this page, brings the question. It all starts with a spring, if anything can ever be said to start. In German, the verb *springen* means jumping. Pular, saltar. Is a water spring a way to jump ahead, connect to other places, engage with past and future?

I think of Siddharta. And Heraclitus. And Krenak. I'll probably come back here and edit this page to turn those names into wiki links. Will I?

Last night I had trouble sleeping, mind buzzing with ideas connected to this research and other projects. I wanted to write them down, but was conscious of having to wake up early today for 2-3 calls in a row. I'll just jot down some notes here expecting to return to them in the future.

Open-ended documentation as disguise. Never to be captured. Virtual as in Terranova. Going soon to Finisterre. Not the Gutemberg press, not the accommodation of blogs and timelines into a limited view of time as a straight arrow (thanks, Le Guin). The global data-eating AI can ingest me today, but tomorrow I won't be the same. They will have to swallow me again, and I'll be a Jonas in the belly of the whale. An old man dragged by a giant fish.
