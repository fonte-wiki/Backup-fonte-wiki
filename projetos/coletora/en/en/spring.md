# The Spring

**[Coletora - English](/projetos/coletora/en)**

One beautiful aspect of doing independent and exploratory research on two languages simultaneously is how much it expands my horizons. For instance, the term *spring*. I type these words on 24/09/2025. Here in Berlin, the summer has clearly gone away three days ago, with unexpected [Equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox) precision (German precision being much more a world renowned cultural expectation than objective fact makes it ever more ironic). The sun has just crossed the Equator line towards the south hemisphere, and will only tilt back in this direction after six months. On the other hand, in the part of the world where my heart is rooted, the spring has just started.

I hear the voice of Tim Maia singing "[Ã‰ Primavera](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primavera_(Vai_Chuva))". I'll make it the first song of my Coletora playlist.
