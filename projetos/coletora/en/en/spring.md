# The Spring

**[Coletora - English](/projetos/coletora/en)**

One beautiful aspect of doing independent and exploratory research across languages is how much it expands my horizons. For instance, the term *spring*. I type this paragraph on the morning of 24/09/2025. Here in Berlin, the summer has clearly gone away three days ago, with unexpected [Equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox) precision ("German precision" being much more a world renowned cultural expectation than objective fact makes it even more ironic). The sun has just crossed the Equator line towards the south hemisphere, and will only tilt back in this direction in another six months. On the other hand, there in that part of the world where my heart is rooted, the **spring** has just started.

So yes, a first meaning for this term. The spring. Frühling. Tim Maia singing "[É Primavera](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primavera_(Vai_Chuva))". I'll make it the first song of my Coletora playlist. Spring, the season.
