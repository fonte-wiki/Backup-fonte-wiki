# The Spring

**[Coletora - English](/projetos/coletora/en)**

One beautiful aspect of doing independent and exploratory research across languages is how much it expands my horizons. For instance, the term *spring*. I type this paragraph on the morning of 24/09/2025. Here in Berlin, the summer has clearly gone away three days ago, with unexpected [Equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox) precision ("German precision" being much more a world renowned cultural expectation than objective fact makes it even more ironic). The sun (yet another wonder of inter-language consideration: *die Sonne* here in Germany, a female noun; *o Sol*, male in Portuguese) has just crossed the Equator line towards the south hemisphere, and will only tilt back in this direction in another six months. On the other hand, there in that part of the world where my heart is rooted, the **spring** has just started.

So yes, a first meaning for this term. The spring. Frühling. Tim Maia singing "[É Primavera](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primavera_(Vai_Chuva))". I should make it the first song of my Coletora playlist. Spring, the season. But also spring, olho d'água, a source of water streaming from inside the earth. I suspect these meanings are connected, here in the northern of the northern hemisphere (but I won't google it, so will take the risk of having gotten it wrong, or else sounding too obvious for native English speakers). Is the spring (the season) that time of the year when water springs return to be seen flowing from the earth, after the white snow is gone? Do springs return to life in during the spring, so to say?

The initial link in another page, from where I created this page, brings the question. It all starts with a spring, if anything can ever be said to start. In German, the verb *springen* means jumping. Pular, saltar. Is a water spring a way to jump ahead, connect to other places, engage with past and future?

I think of Siddharta. And Heraclitus. And Krenak. I'll probably come back here and edit this page to turn those names into wiki links. Will I?

Last night I had trouble sleeping, mind buzzing with ideas connected to this research and other projects. I wanted to write them down, but was conscious of having to wake up early today for 2-3 calls in a row. I'll just jot down some notes here expecting to return to them in the future.

Open-ended documentation as disguise. Never to be captured. Virtual as in Terranova. Going soon to Finisterre. Not the Gutemberg press, not the accommodation of blogs and timelines into a limited view of time as a straight arrow (thanks, Le Guin). The global data-eating AI can ingest me today, but tomorrow I won't be the same. They will have to swallow me again, and I'll be a Jonas in the belly of the whale. An old man dragged by a giant fish.

I edited this text again after first writing, but decided to keep the original mention to a particular date. It's just a departure. The water spring contains the whole river. The river is the spring, and much more. This is not only a subtle nod to the inevitable inconsistency of digital files, it's also a tactics of disguise, of intentional opacity - and here I pretend I did read [Glissant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89douard_Glissant). Haven't yet, it's on my list, but I have smarter friends who quoted and contextualised this concept of his. And I like it, as it reminds me of something we did a long time ago in Pará: [maps in which we recognise ourselves; maps that mislead those we're not interested in](https://hacknet.fonte.wiki/). And certainly, [the only things that interest me are those that are not mine. Law of man. Law of the anthropophagite](https://391.org/manifestos/1928-anthropophagite-manifesto-oswald-de-andrade/).

Text-weaving as labyrinth-making. Or, as I feel more authorised to subvert my native language: *textear como labirintar*. I seem to have trouble being linear. And it's not new. Perhaps these pages are the first time I decide not to care about it, at least "in public". These pages are live - in fonte.wiki, in Coletora -, but arguably no one will read them. Or someone will, and tomorrow I'll have edited these words out. [Be water, my friend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAEDIKjxKPk). 

Wiki-sourcing. There, saw it? I just edited one of the sentences above. It was something, now it change. Which one? What changed? Does it matter?

It starts with a spring. If I were to devise a cosmology right now, there's where I'd start. No fiat lux, no big bang, no igbin snail (though the latter can arguably be interpreted as a spring, can it not?). Still: *um olho d'água*. A water spring. *Uma fonte*, and here is where it comes full circle - oh no, that's an easy expression in this too easy language that I don't want to overuse. No ellyptical circles, please. On that I prefer to resort once again to the igbin and think of spirals. But that's again diverting from my point, so I'll save this thought - spirals - for later (or rather for earlier, as I did indeed write quite a lot on spirals already).

New paragraph, start over. Pretend you just arrived here, dear oh inexistent reader of these lines I'll eventually delete or let rot and disappear. I was writing about springs. Water springs. In Portuguese, that would be a *nascente* or *olho d'água*. But there's another word that I'm trying to approach here: *uma fonte*. For *fonte* can be translated as "fountain", that sort of upward-squirting demonstration of water abundance, but it also can mean "source". As in "water source". And as - through one of those likely poorly-translated anglicisms we Brazilians adopt every so often - "source code". Código-fonte.
