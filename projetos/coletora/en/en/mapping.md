# Mapping

***Oh no, yet another map??***

Overheard during the [Networked Hacklab](https://hacknet.fonte.wiki/) in Par√° in 2014: "we're always invited to contribute with mapping projects, but we rarely see the maps". How to create maps to deceive our powerful opponents?

Sometimes it's just a matter of starting with a map, then intentionally sabotaging it. Tidal maps, maps of rivers and water basins. [La Loire](/projetos/coletora/en/Loire), la [Rance](/projetos/coletora/en/Rance). The [end of earth](/projetos/coletora/en/Finistere).
