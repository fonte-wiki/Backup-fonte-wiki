# La Rance

Saint-Malo was a fortified city of corsairs. Being there obviously made me think of [Pirate Utopias](https://archive.org/details/pirate-utopias-hakim-bey/), which I intend to re-read now. Or soon enough.

Huge waves come crashing and spill as high as the sea-facing buildings. In some places they have wooden spikes before the walls, to soften a bit of the impact. Still, it's impressive. The tidal range is huge - someone there said it can reachup to 16m coeficient. It's not far from the famous Mt Saint-Michel, which lies in another water basin. 

I'll come back to edit this page further and tell stories of boat cemeteries, floating villages, and cooperative highed education.
