# semente (English)

*semente* (Portuguese for "seed") is a **collaborative method** for **designing and visualizing collective projects and processes in a cyclical and regenerative way**. It arises from a **discomfort with the traditional format of projects**, which usually have a defined beginning, middle, and end, disconnected from the lives and experiences of the people involved.

Unlike traditional models, *semente* proposes a **flexible and adaptable approach**, which allows the project to be started from different points:

*   by the **idea / people** (the seed);
*   by the **questions** to be addressed;
*   by the **practices** to be developed;
*   by **previous experiences**.

The *semente* method inverts the linear logic of projects, **valuing the complete and spiral cycle**. The element of renewal at each turn of the spiral is the **seedbag** (a combination of ideas, dreams, intentions, desires, and people, communities, groups). The seedbag is the starting point of the cycle, where ideas, desires, and people come together.

The broad visualization of the life cycle of a project created from the *semente* perspective goes through three stages:

1.  **Seeding**: The process of placing the seed in the soil, preparing the ground for the development of the project.
2.  **Tending**: The development phase of the project, where ideas begin to take shape and become concrete.
3.  **Regeneration**: The reflection phase on the project results, where lessons learned and challenges to be overcome are identified.

Seeding begins when the seed is placed in contact with the **soil**, understood as:

*   everything that is brought from the **past**, lessons learned and records of other **projects** and **experiences**;
*   existing **infrastructure**: tools, equipment, facilities;
*   material and immaterial **resources**.

The transition between Seeding and Tending occurs with the **sprout** (which can be a detailed project description, a prototype, or a pilot). The passage from Tending to Regeneration takes place with the **fruits**: project results, which can be both material and immaterial.

In addition, the method proposes the creation of a **"compost bin"**, a space to store for later solution the **problems**, the **difficulties encountered**, and the **lessons learned**. The idea is to systematize them so that they are considered in future projects, **avoiding the repetition of mistakes**. In turn, the **silo** is where **what comes from the fruits** is stored to **generate more seeds**.

*semente* **seeks to generate conditions for the community to achieve its objectives**, have positive results, and feed the process, creating new desires and intentions. The fruits of the project are not the final objective, but rather part of a larger cycle of development and transformation.

The method is **collaborative** and **values the involvement of all participants**. It has the **potential to be used in different cultural and geographical contexts**, due to the use of biological metaphors and accessible language. *semente* is concerned with **creating projects that reverberate, regenerate, and continue to create over time**.
