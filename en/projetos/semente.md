# Semente

The [portuguese version](pt-br/projetos/semente) of this page may be more up-to-date.

Semente is a toolkit in the making to co-create community-based digital policy. Its current prototype results from a collaboration between the Instituto Neos in Brazil and the University of Bristol. Semente builds knowledge exchange in projects such as [fonte.wiki](https://fonte.wiki) and [ID21](/id21). It is informed by decades of digital rights activism in Brazil and the intention to regenerate fair and inclusive futures with the critical appropriation of digital technologies.

Semente had a series of feedback sessions during the 2022 edition of [Tropixel](https://tropixel.org) in Ubatuba, Brazil.

The attached [slide presentation (PDF)](https://ia904701.us.archive.org/22/items/semente-23/semente_pub.pdf) presents a short overview of the process of building the first prototype of Semente.
