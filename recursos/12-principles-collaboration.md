# 12 Principles of Collaboration

Referência relativamente antiga sobre comunidades ("web") que ainda pode ter relevância: [The 12 principles of collaboration](http://endofweb.pbworks.com/f/12principles.pdf). São os seguintes:

1. Purpose: We have a shared goal or interest.
2. Identity: We know who’s who.
3. Reputation: We recognize and build status based on our actions.
4. Governance: We agree that our behavior can be regulated according to shared or stated values.
5. Communication: We have ways to share information and ideas
6. Groups: We can relate to each other in smaller numbers.
7. Environment: We interact in a shared space that is appropriate to our goals.
8. Boundaries: We know who belongs and who doesn’t.
9. Trust: We know with whom we’re dealing and that it’s safe to do so.
10. Exchange: We can trade knowledge, support, goods, services, and ideas.
11. Expression: We have a group identity and know what other members are doing. We can easily indicate our preferences and opinions.
12. History: We can look back over our history and track our evolution.
