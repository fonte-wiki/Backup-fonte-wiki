> Mozilla’s Core Web Literacy Curriculum consists of Core Activities aligned with the [Web Literacy Map](https://web.archive.org/web/20190428163831/https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/web-literacy/) to provide learners with a basic understanding of the web and web technologies, and with confidence and satisfaction to read - how we explore the web, write - how we build the web, and participate - how we connect on the web.
